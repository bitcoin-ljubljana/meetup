Because the security of Bitcoin is paramount, we have decided to conduct a lecture on storing Bitcoin on **hardware wallets**.
We compared a few hardware wallets with each other. We reviewed the procedures for creating a wallet, interpret displays of assets from them, and attempt to prepare backups.
The brand-new-not-yet-available **Trezor Safe 3**, was a star of the evening, compared to the very fresh **Keystone 3 PRO**. Is there anything simpler than **BitBox02** and smaller than **JADE**?
Elvis answered all questions, doubts, and fears regarding the use of hardware wallets.
