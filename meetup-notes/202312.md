In November, the **Bitcoin Library** completed two projects, which were presented at the **December** Meetup.
1. They finished the translation of the book titled **"The Bullish Case for Bitcoin"** by Vijay Boyapati. Adam Back commented on the book, saying, "The Bullish Case for Bitcoin is an informative and interesting read for both newcomers and long-time Bitcoin enthusiasts. Boyapati convincingly explains Bitcoin with a quick overview of the historical origins of money, descriptions of the characteristics of different forms of money, and why Bitcoin is the best form of money and store of value in the world, with the potential to replace other forms of money."
2. They introduced an introduction to Bitcoin, focusing on its economic and technical aspects, to approximately 80 fourth-year students from the Ljubljana School of Economics, Ro≈°ka.
