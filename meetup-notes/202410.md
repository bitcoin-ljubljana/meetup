# Launch of the book Inventing Bitcoin, a new translation in the Bitcoin knjižnica collection

30.10.2024

"When people first hear about Bitcoin, they form an opinion before they even try to understand it." This is one of Yan Pritzker's opening sentences in the book Inventing Bitcoin, the translation of which we are adding to the Bitcoin knjižnica collection.
While Vijay Boyapati's Bullish Case for Bitcoin explained the reasons for Bitcoin's long-term value through the perspectives of macroeconomic factors, inflation, monetary policy and its role in comparison to other forms of money such as gold and fiat currencies, the book Inventing Bitcoin focuses mainly on technical aspects of Bitcoin. It explains how Bitcoin works, how it is designed, and the technology behind it, including the concept of blockchain, mining, and decentralization. The book does not only deal with the technical aspects of Bitcoin, but also sheds light on the wider picture - from the crisis of confidence in traditional financial systems to the idea of a completely safe, globally accessible and independent money. Pritzker writes in a simple way, which means that readers do not need in-depth technical, mathematical or computer knowledge to understand. Precisely for this reason, it will also appeal to more demanding readers, as they will get simple explanations and outlines of the technical background of Bitcoin, which they can use in more complex cases of coloring eternal skeptics.
