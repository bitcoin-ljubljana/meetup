# Review of 2024

28.1.2025

This time, we discussed all the events that took place in 2024, reviewing what we covered and predicted in previous meetups and seeing what actually came to fruition. We also dived into the new MiCA regulation, explored the implications of the "travel rule," and talked about what we can expect in 2025.

The slides (in slovene) are available here:
