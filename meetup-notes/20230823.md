In **August**, we are organized an event to discuss **Bitcoin in El Salvador**. Our speaker was **Luka Kri≈æ**, a law student and a business and finance enthusiast.
In June 2021, Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador, surprised the world by announcing that the country would adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, becoming the first country to do so. The plan was met with both enthusiasm from cryptocurrency supporters and scepticism from credit agencies and several financial institutions, which felt that the plan could introduce macroeconomic instability into the local economy.
We talked about the **economic history of El Salvador**, what the plan for the **adoption of the new currency entailed**, and analyzed **how the new official currency has affected El Salvador's national economy** since its adoption.
