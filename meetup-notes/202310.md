Bitcoin's state grows with its usage and will continue to do so. We've witnessed projects such as Stamps deliberately embedding data within the ledger state with the aim of rendering it unprunable, thereby ensuring replication across many machines. This could be one of the contributing factors to a 50% increase in state size over the past 6 months.
Tomaz dived into what the ledger state is, how it grows, and how we can leverage a concept called **Utreexo** to operate a full node with the storage requirement reduced to a mere kilobyte of data.
