# Bitcoin as a Communication System

26.6.2024

At the **32nd meetup** of the **Bitcoin Ljubljana group**, we walked through the evolution of communication systems and tried to understand the role that blockchain and Bitcoin play in this context.

**Bitcoin** is frequently called "**hard money**", but what foundational element enables us to create a global ledger? In the first part of our presentation, we explored the history of human communication and its evolution over time, demonstrating how blockchains fit into this natural progression. Finally, we revealed how this new communication system can be leveraged to build potentially far more resilient systems, such as Bitcoin.
