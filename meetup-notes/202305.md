In April we organised an event at the House of Sports in BTC Ljubljana to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the first commercial use of Bitcoin, an event that is now known as **"Bitcoin pizza day"**.
Part of the event will was dedicated to networking and exchanging experiences. And, of course, we enjoyed traditional giant **3 m in diameter, Bitcoin pizza**.
The event expanded and strengthened the Bitcoin community, raised awareness and educated people about Bitcoin.
