# Roundtable at the annual book fair

29.11.2024

At the 40th Slovene Book Fair on Gospodarsko razstavišče **Klemen** had a talk for a wider audience titled
"Bit' Ali Ne Bit' Kojn?" (roughly translated as "To Be or Not To Be A Horse" which is wordplay on Shakespeare and the fact that "bit coin" in slovene language sounds a bit akin to "be a horse", the title can also 
be understood as Bitcoin yes or no? and Klemen draw compeling arguments for normies why the answer should be YES).
