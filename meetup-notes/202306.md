In **June** we organised an event with special guest [**Katie The Russian**](https://twitter.com/KatieTheRussian) from [**Plan B Passport**](https://planbpassport.com).

Katie is the CEO of [Plan B Passport](https://planbpassport.com). Born and raised in Russia. Katie immigrated to the US as a professional athlete and later traded her career in sports for entrepreneurship. With passion for sovereignty and Bitcoin, she founded **Plan B Passport** where she helps Bitcoiners obtain more freedom by getting a second passport, offshore banking, multiple residencies or other instruments of jurisdictional arbitrage.
She talked about **flag theory**, how obtaining multiple passports and residences can help sovereign individuals respond to restrictive government policies and many other things.
