In January **Marko Tarman** from NiceHash talked about **ASIC mining**. Last year, he attended Texas Blockchain Summit where he got an opportunity to visit a 800 MW mining farm. He showed us on what big mining farms from Texas are focusing on right now. He also explained how Texans are understanding that using gas for mining is actually green mining.
