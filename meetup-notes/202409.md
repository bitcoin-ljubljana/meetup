# Blocksize Wars

24.9.2024

At the **34th meetup of the Bitcoin Ljubljana group**, we will discuss the event **"Blocksize War" - a major split within the Bitcoin community**. In doing so, **Klemen** will draw an interesting parallel with another major divide in human civilization, which also sparks a lot of interest. In addition to the lecture, we will also focus on some technological breakthroughs that have recently made the use of Bitcoin and the Lightning network easier.

The slides (in slovene)  are available here:
