At the **28th Bitcoin Ljubljana meetup**, scheduled for **January 31, 2024**, at Caf√© Sputnik, we took a look into the year 2024. We didn't predict the future, nor peer into a crystal ball, but we analyzed what we already know what is coming. We were all eagerly anticipating some positive movements, for which we have at least five well-founded reasons in the upcoming year.
The meetup was led by **Klemen**, who recently wrote an article on this topic and will present it due to immense interest. We discussed upcoming events, such as the recent approval of ETFs, which could catalyze a new cycle of enthusiasm and bullish growth. The meetup had a relaxed atmosphere and didn't delve into the technical aspects of Bitcoin, making it open to all who wanted to hear a more speculative analysis for the upcoming year and socialize with other community members.
